You need to create a playing card shuffler. Each deck contains 4 suits: Spades, Clubs, Hearts and
Diamonds. Each suit has 13 cards: 9 cards numbered from 2 till 10, a Jack, a Queen, a King and an
Ace. There are 52 cards in total.
You're required to:
• Model the cards themselves
• Provide an implementation of the shuffler, which should have:
◦ A method to return the next card on the deck. When there are no further cards, the deck
should automatically reshuffle, and return the next card on the deck.
◦ A method to reshuffle the deck itself.
◦ As this is a single deck shuffler, it should not be possible to return duplicate cards until the
deck is reshuffled (automatically, or explicitly).
An example Java interface would be:
public interface DeckShuffler {
/**
* Provides the next card from a random shuffled deck
*
* @return the next card from the deck
*/
Card nextCard();
/**
* Reshuffles the whole deck again
*/
void reshuffle();
}
