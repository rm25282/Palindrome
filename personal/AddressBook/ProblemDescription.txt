We are migrating CRM solutions, and we have an export of our customer contact details from our
legacy solution in a text file.
The export file format is defined as:
• Each customer on a single line (customers can't be defined in more than one line)
• Each line is formatted as:
◦
<customer name>#<collection of fields separated by '#'...>
◦ Each field is formatted as:
▪
<field index>|<field value>
▪ The field indexes range from 1-4, which describes the field value:
• 1 – First line of customer's address
• 2 – Customer's town
• 3 – Customer's post code
• 4 – Customer's phone number
As an example, our customer 'Bob Smith' who can be reached on '0123456678' and lives at '1, Manor
Avenue, London, SE3' would be formatted to the line:
Bob Smith#1|1, Manor Avenue#2|London#3|SE3#4|0123456678
However, the export process is a “bit buggy”. Even though the format of the exported file is “correct”, it
has quite a few irregularities with the data that need to be fixed:
• Customers are defined on more than one line
• Some lines are incomplete with their field definitions
• For some customers, the same field has been defined more than once on separate lines
You are required to write a method that reads in the exported file, parse it, and re-write a new exported
file:
• Each customer should only be on one line with all fields discovered for that customer on the
same line
• If you discover a field for a customer that has been defined more than once in the file, you
should use the latest field
We have attached a file called “addressbook.txt” which is the exported file with irregularities that need
to be fixed.
We're not certain on the exact number of customers that we have in the CRM, but we think it should
be somewhere between 11,000 – 12,000. We do know that all customers in our CRM should have all 4
fields mentioned above.
We have another CRM database due for migration with close to 1,000,000 customers, which we're
hoping your solution will be fast enough that we can re-use it.
An example Java interface would be:
public interface AddressBookFixer {
void fixAddressBook(String inputFilename, String outputFilename);
}
